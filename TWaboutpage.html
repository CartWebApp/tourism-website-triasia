            <h2>About the Philippines</h2>
            <p>The island of Taiwan is first believed to be setteled by Malayo-Polynesian aborigines. The island has been 
                visited by both Europeans and Chinese merchants, fishermen, and pirates. The first recorded history between
                Taiwan and China was in 239 CE, when a 10,000 nab nission was sent by the Emperor to explore the island. 
                They brought back several aboriginall people from the island to be taught Chinese culture and language. 
                Another mission was sent to gather up motr information. In 1430, Zheng He (or Cheng Ho) landed on the island 
                and obtained herbal medicines that were stated by the natives to have "miracle power." <br></p>
            <p>In 1517, the Portuguese sailed through the Taiwan Strait and according to the ship's log
                as "Ilha Formosa" meaning "Beautiful Island." Formosa became the Western term for Taiwan.
                Despite this, the Portuguese did not claimed Taiwan and the Dutch would established theirs
                later on. Spanish adventurers would established their presence on the island but were ousted
                by the Dutch in 1642.The Dutch themselves would be expelled from the island in early 1662 ater
                their defeat from Zheng Chenggong (Cheng Ch'eng-kung or Koxinga). This was seen as the first
                instance of the "liberation" of a colony under Western influence. Following the Treaty of 
                Shimonoseki (1895), which ended the first Sino-Japanese War, the provision gave Taiwan and the 
                P'eng-hu Islands to the Empire of Japan. Under the Empire of the Rising Sun, Taiwan saw some 
                advancement in its economy and science. Taiwan would particpart in World War 2 that would see the 
                deaths of 30,000 soldiers in combat roles. It was left alone by the Allies though U.S. air raids did
                damage the oil-storage depots. After the end of the war, Taiwan was handed back to the Kuomintang 
                government under Chiang Kai-shek. However after the Nationaltist defeat from the Communist from the 
                Chinese Civil War, the remaining ones loyal to the Republic of China moved to Taiwan. Under the Chiang's 
                rule, Taiwan's economy took off in the mid-1960s amf has cause Taiwant o become known as an "economic miracle."</p>
                <p>Today Taiwan has become a tourist attraction to young tourist and foregin-exchanged students from around the world
                    due to its attracting food and culture along with its unqiue branches of government and economy system. Visiters 
                    should explore the island and learn more about it's history and culture. Visiters attracted to Taiwan would likely be
                    from the ages of 18 to 29 years old."<br></p>
