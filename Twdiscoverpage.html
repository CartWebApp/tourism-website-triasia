                <h2>Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival</h2>
                <p class="TWdiscover-information-content">An event younger millennials should definitely attend is the Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival in Taiwan! 
                    The purpose of this festival is to partake in showing the true spirit of Taiwan by virtue of the lanterns which transcend the peoples prayers and vows 
                    across the night sky. 
                    Additionally, this festival makes for beautiful scenery in person, which also, as told by Rove, 
                    “This unique Taiwanese lantern festival was voted by the Discovery Channel as the second biggest New Year’s Eve celebration in the world!” 
                    Theoretically, this means that the festival will be highly populated and full of people there to experience the lanterns. 
                    In relation to the population of the festival, Rove also states that, “Every year, the festival gathers an estimated number of about 100,000 to 200,000 people.” 
                    This is a high estimate which can definitely guarantee that there will be ecstatic and positive energy during the festival.
                <br> <br> In contrast, young millennials and other tourists must see and attend the Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival because it 
                makes for one of the best winter trips. As said by Roxanne and Maartje, 
                “Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival takes place once a year. . . during the first full moon of the Lunar New Year. . . 
                As this date varies yearly, the Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival is held on a different date every year.” 
                This is a great thing because it will mean that the festival will take place in different seasons each year, 
                which could potentially attract or amaze other people. Secondly, one thing to know about the Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival is the right 
                location of where it takes place. Roxanne and Maartje state that, “Pingxi Lantern Festival takes place in the Pingxi district, in New Taipei City. . . 
                Lantern releases are held in the towns Jingtong, Pingxi and Shifen. . . The biggest event is in Shifen, where they set up the main stage at a parking area and 
                it is transformed into the Shifen Sky Lantern Square.” This is a notable thing to have information about because viewers wanting to partake in the festival might 
                get confused about the location. This is due to the fact that although it takes place in Pingxi district, there is a town called Pingxi residing in the district. 
                In emphasis, this means that there are also other towns as stated before by Roxanne and Maartje. Historically, according to Roxanne and Martje, 
                “The sky lanterns were historically used as military signs. In the mid 19th century the little mountain villages were often under attack by bandits. 
                The lanterns were used by the people living in the villages to let others know they were safe.” It’s impressive to see how much meaning these lanterns 
                still hold even if their use of them is different compared to back then. Lastly, young millennials should participate in viewing this event because it 
                indulges one into the culture of Taiwan and fills the eyes with graceful beauty.

                <h2>For Brandon Lu's Discover Info</h2>
                <p class="TWdiscover-information-content">When it comes to food, the Philippines has a diverse selection for everybody to enjoy, and with great food comes great ways of enjoying them, which younger demographics would definitely need to experience, which is Kamayan. Kamayan is the traditional method of eating done by Filipinos on a grand feast that disregards the utensils and enjoys the experience of eating using hands, as the name is literally translated to “by hand.” Kamayan is usually used when eating large servings of food laid out on large banana leaves, but it can be done no matter what the occasion to save time on having to clean up utensils. According to MG Sanchez, this is also referred to as a “boodle fight,” originating from when military soldiers of different ranks “fought” to see who can eat more than the others. When it comes to these feasts, there are a variety of foods served, which as claimed by Jasmine P. Ting, include “a mountain of food— a mound of fluffy white jasmine rice, piled high with myriad savory dishes like grilled tilapia, lumpia, a soupy dish like adobo or tinola, steamed vegetables, and fresh fruit.” With plenty of selections to be made, getting to experience this tradition will truly be satisfying.</p>
